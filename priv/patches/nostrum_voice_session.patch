This patch modifies Nostrum's voice session to:
1. Skip packets that fail to decrypt (likely keep-alives)
2. Only log successful decryptions
3. Add more RTCP packet filtering

Apply manually to deps/nostrum/lib/nostrum/voice/session.ex

In handle_info({:udp, ...}), replace the rescue block with:
```elixir
rescue
  %MatchError{term: :error} ->
    # Likely a keep-alive packet or unsupported format - silently skip
    :ok
  error ->
    Logger.warning("Received bad voice packet in guild_id #{state.guild_id}: #{inspect(error)}")
end
```

And add more RTCP filtering before the decrypt:
```elixir
# Skip all RTCP packets (types 200-207)
<<2::2, _::1, _::5, pt::8, _rest::binary>> when pt >= 200 and pt <= 207 ->
  :noop
```
