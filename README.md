## Prerequisites

1. A bot token with the following permissions:

- Send Messages
- Read Message History
- View Channels
- Connect
- Speak

**NOTE: Also remember to go under Bot and select PRESENCE INTENT, SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT**

You then need to invite the bot to your server by going to `Oauth2`, checking `bot` and then checking the same permisions as above. You can then take the generated URL at the bottom and invite the bot.

2. If you want to host publicly, a domain name is required so people can access your Soundbored instance.

3. Under `Redirect` in `Oauth2` put your domain like `https://your.domain.com/auth/discord/callback` in the Discord Developer Portal. Copy the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` as you will need them for the environment variables below.

4. You will need to host this publicly somewhere for other users to be able to use it. I recommend using [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) for this as its cheap and you can deploy Docker images directly.


## Setup
The Docker needs the following environment variables, check .env.example:

```
API_TOKEN=make_up_a_token_here

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_actual_discord_token
DISCORD_CLIENT_ID=your_actual_client_id
DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_actual_client_secret
# Change this to your domain or to localhost if you're running locally
PHX_HOST=your.domain.com
# change this to http if running locally
SCHEME=https
# Change these to password protect your soundboard
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME=admin
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=admin
DISABLE_AUTO_JOIN=true
```


## Deployment

The application is containerized and published to Docker Hub. You can pull it with `docker pull christom/soundbored:latest`. Or run immediately in localhost with: `docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --env-file ./.env christom/soundbored`.

### Local Deployment
```bash
# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values, make sure:
PHX_HOST=localhost
SCHEME=http


# With Docker Image, run locally (no Caddy)
docker run -d -p 4000:4000 --env-file ./.env christom/soundbored

# Or with Project cloned, Run locally (no Caddy)
docker compose up
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
# Create .env file from example
cp .env.example .env

# Edit .env with your values, make sure:
PHX_HOST=your.domain.com
SCHEME=https

# Modiy the Caddyfile
your.domain.com {
    reverse_proxy soundbored:4000
}

# Pull the latest image
docker pull christom/soundbored:latest

# Run in production (with Caddy)
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d
```

The deployment mode is automatically determined by the PHX_HOST value:
- If PHX_HOST=localhost: Runs without Caddy, accessible at http://localhost:4000
- If PHX_HOST=domain.com: Runs with Caddy, handles SSL automatically

Note: Make sure to create a Caddyfile in the same directory as your docker-compose.prod.yml file. The Caddyfile should contain your domain configuration. For example:

```
your.domain.com {
    reverse_proxy soundbored:4000
}
```

Replace `your.domain.com` with your actual domain name. Caddy will automatically handle SSL certificate generation for your domain.


## Usage

After inviting the bot to your server, join a voice channel and type `!join` to have the bot join the voice channel. Type `!leave` to have the bot leave. You can upload sounds to Soundbored and trigger them there and they will play in the voice channel.

The bot is also able to auto-join and auto-leave voice channels. This is controlled by the DISABLE_AUTO_JOIN environment variable. If you set it to false, the bot will join voice channels where users are present and auto-leave when the last user leaves.

## API

The API is used to trigger sounds from other applications. It is protected by the API_TOKEN in the .env file. The API has the following endpoints:

```
# Get list of sounds to find the ID
curl https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN"

# Play a sound by ID
curl -X POST https://soundboardurl.com/api/sounds/123/play \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer API_TOKEN" \
```
