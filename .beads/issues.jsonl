{"id":"soundboard-3g0","title":"Stop full sound list reload on stats updates","description":"Every play broadcasts :stats_updated from Stats.track_play/2. SoundboardLive (and FavoritesLive) subscribe to stats_topic and handle :stats_updated by calling load_sound_files/1, which reloads all sounds with tags, user_sound_settings, and users. Repro: play one sound; logs show large IN(...) queries for user_sound_settings/tags repeated multiple times (e.g., 05:15:27 logs). Expected: plays should not reload entire sound catalog; only file changes should trigger that. Need to drop or gate the stats subscription, or throttle/restrict reloads.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T00:17:32.28608-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T00:17:32.28608-05:00"}
{"id":"soundboard-pc4","title":"Reduce duplicate stats refresh on play events","description":"Single play triggers both :sound_played and :stats_updated handlers in StatsLive, causing back-to-back queries for recent plays/top users/top sounds. Repro: open /stats, play a sound; logs show multiple SELECTs for plays/sounds in same ms (see 2025-11-30 05:15:27-28 logs). Expected: one refresh per play. Suspect double subscription (soundboard_topic + stats_topic) plus both handlers. Need to dedupe/choose single event, possibly debounce.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-11-30T00:17:27.446917-05:00","updated_at":"2025-11-30T00:17:27.446917-05:00"}
